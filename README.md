# 2nd-python-project---Word-Counter
Made another ugly project, slowly learning new concepts while building

WHAT I LEARNED: 
Splitting sentence with split function, 
Counting vowels 

	count = 0
	vowels = "AEIOUaeiou" # <---- This is the main component for logic
	for i in sentence:
		if i in vowels:
			count += 1
	print(f"There are {count} vowels")
